= 03 Testing Spring Boot (5)

* Generate a project from `start.spring.io`
* Write the `PersonFetcher` class (Deliberately use field injection)
* Write the `Person` class
* Write the `PersonPrinter` class
* Show the basic Spring Boot test
* `@Autowire` `PersonFetcher` and assert the response
* Explain that it boots up the whole context, it's slower than it should be
* Emphasise that field injection is evil - it forces you to start the whole context
* Do we actually need any Spring features? Why do those classes even know anything about Spring?
* Constructor injection, separate bean generation to `@Configuration`
* Now you can use the configuration class, or set the beans manually
* Time... 120 ms vs ~0 ms
