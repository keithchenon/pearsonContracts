* One of the tools to do that is called WireMock - http://wiremock.org
* Show the request / reply thing from the website
* You can do it either via JSON or via code (that gets translated to JSON anyways)
* Run the test that will do connection refused
* Setup WireMock
** Show method rule and class rule
** Setup the code
```java
		this.rule.stubFor(WireMock.get("/person/1")
				.willReturn(WireMock.aResponse()
						.withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
						.withBody("{\"name\":\"m1\"}")));
		this.rule.stubFor(WireMock.get("/person/2")
				.willReturn(WireMock.aResponse()
						.withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
