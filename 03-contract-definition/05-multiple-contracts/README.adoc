= 05 Define multiple contracts in a single file (5)

== Before

* Remove `src/test/resources/contracts`

== Presentation

* Show the `starter-verifier` dependency in the `pom.xml`
* Explain that we will use the Contract plugin only to generate tests and stubs - we will not run them
* Create a new file `contracts_in_dsl.yml`
** create an array of three contracts
** explain that you can use code if you need things more complex
** what about naming? you either get a number suffix or you can override the name
** override the name via the `name` method
* Create a new file `contracts_in_yaml.yml`
** Repeat the same process as above
* Show the generated test and stubs
