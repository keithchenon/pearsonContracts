= 02 Perform provider contract testing with SC-Contract and Spring REST Docs (10)

== Before

* Make a copy of the lesson for Gradle
* Remove maven setup, update Gradle setup to remove custom test tasks etc.
* Open the copy in IDE

== Presentation

* Slides
* Generate a new web project with rest docs from start.spring.io
** web, rest docs, stub runner
* Create a `PersonControllerTests` (don't add the stub piece)
** Make the tests fail
** Add the missing implementation
** Make the tests pass
** Show the generated snippets
* Modify the `pom.xml`
** add `asciidoctor-maven-plugin` and `copy-resource` plugin and explain what is going on
** Add `src/main/asciidoc/index.adoc` (`scc_05_02_index_adoc` live template)
** `./mvnw clean install`
** show the generated documentation under `target`
** run the app go to `http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html`
* We've achieved pretty much the same as in the previous lesson
** however we have an additional folder `stubs` that contains stubs, where did that come from?
** by having Spring Cloud Starter Contract Stub Runner on the classpath we automatically generate stubs
** you can add dynamic pieces to is (add the dynamic piece, rebuild and show the new json)
* Now it's time to package it into a jar
** Add maven assembly plugin (`scc_assembly` LT)
** Add the `src/assembly/stub.xml` (`scc_assembly_stub_xml` LT)
* Run the build and show the packaged stubs

* Go to the Gradle copy
** Show the Gradle setup
** Run `./gradlew clean build`
** show the generated documentation under `build`
** run the app go to `http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html`
