= 03 Generate Contract DSL from Spring REST Docs (5)

== Before

* Remove the line that adds conracts
* Make a copy of the lesson for Gradle
* Remove maven setup, update Gradle setup to remove custom test tasks etc.
* Open the copy in IDE

== Presentation

* Show the setup for Maven, mention once again what we have
* How can we be sure that we haven't broken the compatibility?
** If the tests fail, we break the compatibility
** How can we double check? What is the source of truth?
** Contract definition can tell us how the API looks like for the given version
** We can start generating contract definitions from REST Docs
** Add the `SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()` entry for `index`
** Let's modify the way we package stubs (add `contracts` folder in `stubs.xml`)
** Let's install the code `./mvnw clean install`
** Right now we have the current version installed
* Let's automate the verification of API compatibility check
** Update the version to 2.0.0
** Add the `apicompatibility` profile (`scc_apicompat_maven_local` LT)
** Add the `BaseClass` that sets up `WebApplicationContext` and `RestAssured.webAppContext(...)`
** Run the build `./mvnw clean install -Papicompatibility -Dlatest.prod.version=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`)
** Show that in this easy way you can automate verification of backward compatibility

* Show the Gradle setup of the same thing
** Run `./gradlew
