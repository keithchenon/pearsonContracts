= 04 Generate Spring REST Docs snippets from Contract DSL (5)

== Presentation

* Slides
* Explain the application setup
** Show contract, controller, generated test and base class
** Mention what we typically have in the base class
** Show that RestAssured accepts RestDocs as a plugin
** You can leverage the test class name and method name to create the name of the snippet directory
** Run the test and show the snippets
* What else can you do with RestAssured and REST Docs?
** Even though the Spring team doesn't recommend it, people often use tools like Swagger to evolve their APIs
** People ask for code generation mechanisms
** You can leverage REST Docs to achieve both
* Generation
** Show `install restdocs-to-postman` maven setup
** Explain that it's a nodejs tool that does what it says
** Show the custom `test/bash/generate_swagger.sh` and explain what happens there
** Last step (since we have the `swagger.json`) is to use the `swagger-codegen-cli-2.2.1` to generate the code
*** show the maven setup
*** show `target/generated-sources/swagger_codegen`
