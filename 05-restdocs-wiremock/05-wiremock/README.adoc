= 05 Test your application with SC-Contract and WireMock (5)

==  Before

* Remove entries from `DemoApplicationTests`
* Remove `FailuresTests`

== Presentation

* Sometimes you need to work with WireMock manually, sometimes you actually should do that
* Show the `pom.xml`, explain that `WireMock` comes in automatically via the starter
* Write the tests
** Connection refused
** Add WireMock, set the port, send a request again, show WireMock's 404
** Add a stub, show WireMock's table, fix it
** Set WireMock's port to `0` and inject it via `wiremock.server.port`
** Show the `ClassRule` and explain that mappings under `mappings` are always picked up
** Explain what `MockRestService` is and show you can use it with WireMock
* Show the `DemoApplication2Tests` class
** Show `files` and `stubs`, explain the difference
* Time for failures
** Rarely do we check how our client reacts on failures
** WireMock is a perfect tool to inject faults
* Write tests
** Setup `RestTemplate` with `SimpleConnectionFactory` having short `read` and `connect` timeouts
** `should_fail_with_timeout`
** `should_fail_with_connection_reset_by_peer`
** `should_fail_with_empty_response`
** `should_fail_with_malformed`
** `should_fail_with_random`
