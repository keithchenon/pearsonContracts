= 04 Fetch stubs from classpath (5)

== Presentation

* In Spring we eat our dog food, Sagan is the application behind `spring.io` website
* Classpath is the default
* Show the `pom.xml` and show that we upload stubs
** Mention that the transitivity is important
* Show Artifactory, show that the JAR is uploaded
* Show that you can use a JUnit rule or `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`
* Run the test, show the test is passing
* Show the logs and explain what `AetherStubDownloader` does
* Show the started WireMocks

IMPORTANT: Say that if you have a multimodule Maven / Gradle project, Intellij will not work with classpath mode. It will work from the command line but not from the IDE.
