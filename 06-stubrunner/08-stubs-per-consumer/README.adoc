= 08 Leverage stubs per consumer feature to do consumer-driven contract testing (5)

== Before

* Remove the expected exception annotations

== Presentation

* Show the application
** Show contracts, each for a separate consumer
** Run the build
* Show the `DemoApplicationTests`
** Explain that what we want to achieve is to load only those stubs that we, as consumers, care about
** Turn on the flag, read the consumer name from `spring.application.name` or set it up manually
** Run the tests and show that the first will pass, the second will not
** If stubs per consumer switch if off, both pass
* Next show the same for the rule version
