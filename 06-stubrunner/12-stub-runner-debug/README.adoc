= 12 Debug problems with stubs (5)

== Before

* Change `TestRestTemplate` to `RestTemplate`

== Presentation

* Problems with mappings tend to happen
** Run the tests and show that they are failing
** You can put `mappingsOutputFolder` in the annotation to output registered mappings
** You can set `deleteStubsAfterTest` to false to find the fetched stubs after the test was done
** Most important is the WireMock report though
