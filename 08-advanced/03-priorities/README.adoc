= 03 Work with priorities in contracts (5)

== Before

* Remove the priority fields

== Presentation

* Show two contracts
** Groovy has the `age` in the body
** Yaml has `name` and `age` in the body
* Explain the problem
** One contract forms a part of the other
** when you send the request with `name` and `age`, which one should be picked?
* Run the tests, they will fail
** Explain the failure
** Show the WireMock logs in loading up proper contracts
* Add priority `old: 10`, `young: 20`
** Rerun the tests, now they pass
** Explain that sometimes you can be lucky cause the order of loading files will be correct
