= 04 Use stateful stubs: Contracts representing scenarios (5)

== Presentation

* Sometimes your stubs need state
** It's not really a recommended practice
** It's better to keep the stubs extremely simple
* If you really need to store state, you can introduce stateful stubs by providing a prefix to the contract name
* Let us assume that we have contracts representing a saturday night situation in a bar
** you were sober, now you're tipsy
** you were tipsy, now you're drunk
** you were drunk, now you're wasted
** in other words whenever we hit an endpoint we would like it to reflect that state
** note the prefixes in front of contracts
** let's look at the contracts
* Show the generated tests
* Show the production code
* Show how we manage state in the base class
* Show the client code
