= 05 Stub out service discovery (5)

== Presentation

* If we're using Service Discovery we don't want to run the server each time
** We know that we can run Stub Runner Boot, but we want the tests to be fast
** How can we achieve it with Spring Cloud Contract
* Show the producer, nothing interesting there
* Show the consumer production code, explain load balanced once again
* Show the test
** Explain that by default we will map the server id to the artifact id of the WireMock server
** Rarely do you actually do it like this, you typically have a name for your collaborator, like `person-service` or sth like this
** That's why you can do a mapping (show `application.yml`)
** That way Spring Cloud Contract knows how to route your call
