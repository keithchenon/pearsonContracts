= 06 Register your own WireMock extension (5)

== Before

* Temporarily add the `producer` and `consumer` maven modules

== Presentation

* You can extend the way WireMock works
** WireMock has the concept of extensions
** You can add a response extension
** Let us assume that we would like to add a header to the response
* Go to `wiremock-transformer` and show the `TestWireMockExtensions` class
** Explain that we must implement the interface
** Explain what the extension does
** Explain that we add the default transformers
** Explain that we need add the `spring.factories` entry
* GO to the `producer`
** Show that we add the dependency to the plugin's classpath
** Show the generated stubs
* Go to the `consumer`
** Show the dependency
** Show that the test passes because the header is there
