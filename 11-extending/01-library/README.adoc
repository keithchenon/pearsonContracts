= 01 Create a library with shareable code (10)

== Presentation

* Slides
* Show the `common` project
** Show that `spec` is enough of a dependency
** Show `ConsumerUtils`, explain `ClientDslProperty` is a property for the Client Side - no need for `value()`
** Show `ProducerUtils`, explain it
** Show `PatternUtils` - most frequently asked for extension
* Show the `producer` project
** Show the dependencies in maven and gradle
** We're extending the classpath of the plugin
** We also want the dependency in test scope for IDE
** IMPORTANT: In a multimodule project you will have a problem if the dependency hasn't been already installed
*** The best approach is to either exclude a producer from the modules (but still build it) or build the common module separately
** Show the contracts
* Show the `consumer` project
** Show the dependencies in maven and gradle
** Run the tests on the consumer side
