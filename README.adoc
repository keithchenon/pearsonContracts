=  Hands-On Guide to Spring Cloud Contract LiveLessons by Marcin Grzejszczak

This repository contains all the code presented during the Hands-On Guide to Spring Cloud Contract LiveLessons.

== Folder structure

* Each lesson has its own folder (e.g `01-introduction-to-testing`).
* Whenever you see a folder starting with `00` - that's a helper folder that is used for other sublessons
* Each folder contains a `README.adoc` with steps taken during recording of a lesson

== Prerequisites

To run the samples you need to have the following installed:

* JDK (min. 8)
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Curl
* JQ
* Maven

Nice to have:

* SDKMan (you can install Maven and JDK with it)

== How to build it?

Just run the maven build

```
$ ./mvnw clean install
```
